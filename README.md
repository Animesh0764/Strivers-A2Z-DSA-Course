https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/

This cheatsheet is to help anyone trying to learn DSA and can be helpful for interviews or personal skill building. Kindly don't copy paste these codes just to show your progress and impress anyone. You are doing this for youself, not for someone else. You can benefit from it, or you yourself can become a failure. Try out the problems on your own and if you are stuck for a long long time, even after understanding the algorithm, then and only then refer to these.

Happy Coding!!
